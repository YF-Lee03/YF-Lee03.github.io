\noindent Question: Prove that the number of subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ whose size is divisible by 3 is either $\lfloor\frac{2^n}{3}\rfloor$ or $\lceil\frac{2^n}{3}\rceil$.\\

\noindent\textit{Proof:}

Let $a_n$ be the number of subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ whose size is $3i$ where $i=1,2,3,\ldots$, similarly, let $b_n$ be the number of subsets whose size is $3i-1$ and $c_n$ be the number of subsets whose size is $3i-2$. Similar to the problem of odd and even case, we try to use induction.

To show that $a_n=\lfloor\frac{2^n}{3}\rfloor$ or $a_n=\lceil\frac{2^n}{3}\rceil$, we need to show $|a_n-\frac{2^n}{3}|<1$. Let $A_n=a_n-\frac{2^n}{3}$, similarly, let $B_n=b_n-\frac{2^n}{3}$ and $C_n=c_n-\frac{2^n}{3}$. Then what we need is $|A_n|<1$ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$

Since the total number of subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ is $2^n$, thus
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq1}
    A_n+B_n+C_n=0
\end{equation}
For $n=1$, it is easy to check that $|A_n|,|B_n|,|C_n|$ are all less than 1. Suppose for $n=k$, they are also less than 1, then we need to show that $|A_{k+1}+B_{k+1}|<1$, which is equivalent to $|C_{k+1}|<1$ by equation\eqref{eq1}.

Then we try to find some relations between $\{A_n\}$, $\{B_n\}$ and $\{C_n\}$ to help us. For $A_{k+1}$, we know that $A_{k+1}=A_k+B_k=-C_k$ since $a_{k+1}=a_k+b_k$ and $A_{k+1}=a_{k+1}-\frac{2^{k+1}}{3}$. Similarly, $C_{k+1}=C_k+A_k=-B_k$ and $B_{k+1}=B_k+C_k=-A_k$. Thus we have $|A_{k+1}|$, $|B_{k+1}|$, $|C_{k+1}|$ are all less than 1. Then by induction, we have $|a_n-\frac{2^n}{3}|<1$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
