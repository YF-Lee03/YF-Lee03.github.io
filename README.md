<!-- ### About me -->

This is a personal blog for mathematics. Some of the interesting topics would be posted here.

<!-- ## Remarks

Here I'd like to thank the lecturers who delivered the (usually) amazing lectures, and all of those who helpfully pointed out my mistakes and typos.

Note that the notes have been continuously modified, and do not necessarily accurately reflect what the lecturer said or thought (It is only my personal viewpoint). In particular, all errors are (almost certainly) mine. -->
